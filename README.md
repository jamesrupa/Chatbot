# Steve the Chatbot
**Java Natural Language Processing**\
*Created By James Rupa*

## Project Description

Steve the Chatbot is the most basic chatbot or natural language processor there is. The majority of the code was taken and used from the Magpie lab but uses arrays and a few added features. Steve the Chatbot is run through a terminal that asks questions based on the context. Feel free to download the code and alter it to your liking and just experiment with it.

## How To Use The Project

This project was built off of previous code and is a basic Chatbot that is run through your terminal or any Java IDE. There are no additional actions or instructions you need other than to run it and have fun. To end the program just type in "bye" and the Chatbot will greet you "goodbye" and terminate.

## Future Plans

Create a chatbot with a working GUI to make it more interactive and appealing to people.
